Prediction of Flight Delays using Artifical Neural Networks

The code predicts whether a flight operating from Route A to Route B would be delayed or not using Artifical Neural Network.

At the moment, this code predicts flight delay from HNL to OGG but this can be expanded to other routes easily.

The features included are Flight Operations, Flight Statistics and Weather Conditions.
